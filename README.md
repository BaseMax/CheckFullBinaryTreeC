# Check Full Binary Tree in C

This is a simple program to check if a binary tree is full or not.

# Tree

A tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children. The topmost node is called the root node. The nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children. The two children of a node are called the left child and the right child.

## Full Binary Tree

A full binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which all nodes have either zero or two child nodes. Conversely, there is no node in a full binary tree, which has one child node.
